# Smart Occupancy Monitoring System

A hardware-based **Smart Occupancy Monitoring System** implemented using **Verilog HDL** on the **PYNQ-Z2 FPGA** platform. The system accurately counts the number of people entering and exiting a room using **IR break-beam sensors** and **Finite State Machine (FSM)** logic. It provides real-time occupancy monitoring, capacity control, and energy-efficient automation suitable for smart buildings, classrooms, offices, and public spaces.

## 📌 Project Overview

Conventional occupancy monitoring systems based on microcontrollers often suffer from sequential processing delays and limited real-time performance. This project overcomes these limitations by implementing the entire design in hardware on an FPGA, enabling deterministic timing, parallel processing, and high-speed operation.

The system uses two IR sensors placed at the entrance of a room to detect movement direction. Based on the sensor activation sequence, an FSM determines whether a person is entering or exiting and updates the occupancy count accordingly.

## ⚙ Working Principle

1. Two IR sensors continuously monitor the doorway.
2. When a person crosses the entrance, the IR beam is interrupted.
3. Sensor signals are synchronized and filtered.
4. The FSM determines movement direction.
5. Entry increments the occupancy count.
6. Exit decrements the occupancy count.
7. The updated occupancy is displayed.
8. If the room exceeds the maximum capacity, an alert is generated.
